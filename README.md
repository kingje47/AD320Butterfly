Our application will be a shopping wish list app. The wishlist app will allow users to add items to the list, monitor price changes, and share the list with other users. 
1) As a user I am able to create shopping list, and a wishlist of things to buy.
2) All the item input by users will write into mysql database 
3) User can add delete to a shopping list 
4) User would be able to sort the shopping list manually.
